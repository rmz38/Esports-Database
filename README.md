A website to store the information of my organization's members.

When deployed, a sqlite file is generated to store tables and data.

Then, you have the ability to search through members using filters.

The purpose of this site is to easily check how many members for a certain criteria, such as counting how many people play a specific game or checking if a decent amount of people are first-year students or about to graduate.

This site is made with PHP and sql and uses a sticky form to store user information in case an invalid entry was made.

Note: If you want to view all results, press search while leaving the search entry blank.
